		<p style="color:white;font-size:20px">The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive,
			hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by energy produced by nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Part
			of this internal energy is emitted from its surface as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation,
			providing most of the energy for life on Earth. </p>

		<p style="color:white;font-size:20px">Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old yellow dwarf star – a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium – at the center of our solar
			system. It's about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth and it's our solar system's only star. Without the Sun's energy, life as we know it 
			could not exist on our home planet.</p>
